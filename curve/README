x25519 and x448 in V-language
-----------------------------

This module provides two function specified in RFC 7748 Elliptic Curves for Security, 
in the form x25519 and x448 function for elliptic curves over prime fields.
For arithmatic operations, this implementation relies on `v_gmp` module from VincentLaisney.
It's availables at https://github.com/VincentLaisney/v_gmp. It was V-lang binding  
to `GMP`, The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library that mostly available 
on all platform.

NOTE: Use this with your own risk, not fully tested, and you've been warned!
